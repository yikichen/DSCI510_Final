# Problems

reddit API only allows 2000 data per request, so I use the https://api.pushshift.io
https://api.pushshift.io only allows 250 data per request, so I use loop to get all the data

T-test is to compare means
Correlation is to compare the relationship between two variables

Vader is a sentiment analysis tool, it can be used to analyze the sentiment of a sentence
However, it is not very accurate, so I use the sentiment analysis tool of Transformers
